# beams
The Berkeley ElectromAgnetic Modal Solver or beams solves the Maxwell's equations using the Fourier Modal Method (FMM). Currently in the very early stages of development this Python module lacks many basic features, a documentation, and an easy to use interface. However there are plans on implementing the latest advances in electromagnetic modal methods as the software matures.

## To-do:
- Make the serial implementation work correctly for the simple cases.
- Documentation!
- Add some parallelization and measure the speed-up.
- Add support for dispersive materials.
- Implement an inbuilt eigenmode solver.
- Add support for magnetic materials.
- Add support for anisotropic materials.
- Include Legendre and Chebyshev polynomial bases.
- Integrate with an optimization toolbox for inverse-design.
- Add a non-linear solver for.

## Disclaimer:
*At present this is a playground for parallelizing FMM for UC Berkeley's CS267. Nothing here will work as expected.*
